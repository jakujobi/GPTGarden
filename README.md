# GPT Garden ðŸŒ±
----

Welcome to my digital greenhouseâ€”GPT Gardenâ€”where I've been cultivating some friendly AI companions designed to tackle all sorts of tasks.
Whether it's nailing your driver's license test or mastering the arcane arts of assembly language, there's a bot here that's got your back.

## What's Growing in the Garden?

In the GPT Garden, you'll find a quirky bunch of assistants, each with its own specialty. They're pretty chill but super helpful when it comes to their area of expertise. Here's the crew:

- **South Dakota Driver's License Prep Assistant**: This buddy is like the reliable friend who helps you practice for that DMV theory test.
- **Furlana Pet Vet**: Kinda like that vet student who gives free advice about your pet at parties.
- ... and there's more where that came from!

Each assistant lives in its own subfolder, complete with all the goodies you need to get startedâ€”like a friendly guide walking you through their garden patch.

## Getting Started

To get these buddies up and running, follow these steps:
- Go to the of the assistant in this repository
- Click the link: It takes you to their page on Openai GPT store

## Contribute to the Ecosystem

Got an idea to spruce up the place? Or want to plant a new assistant? Here's how:

1. Fork it (top right, you can't miss it).
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AwesomeIdea`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some AwesomeIdea'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AwesomeIdea`).
5. Create a new Pull Request and tell me all about it.

Your contributions help this garden grow, so don't be shyâ€”everyone started as a seedling!
